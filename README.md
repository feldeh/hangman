# Hangman Game

This project was completed as part of the AI Bootcamp at BeCode.org. It is a simple implementation of the Hangman game in Python. In this game, a random word is chosen from a predefined list of words and the player has to guess the letters of the word within a certain number of attempts.

## Installation

To run the Hangman game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the project to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
4. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5. Enjoy playing Hangman!

## Usage

When the game starts, you will be prompted in your terminal to enter a letter as your guess. Make sure to enter a single letter and press `Enter`. The game will then provide feedback on whether your guess is correct or not. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
